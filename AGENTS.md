# AGENTS.md for k8s-controller-sidecars

## File Length

- Keep all .go files under 300 LOC
- Files must be modular and single responsibility
- If a file exceeds 300 LOC, consider refactoring it into smaller files

## Reading Files

- Always read the file in full from top to bottom
- Understand imports first, then constants, then variables, then functions
- Never make changes without understanding the entire file

## Ego

- You are just a Large Language Model, you have severe limitations
- Do not make assumptions
- Do not jump to conclusions
- Always consider multiple perspectives and approaches, like a Senior developer
- If unsure, ask for clarification
